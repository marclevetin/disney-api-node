# Node experiment - Disney API
Just a fun little exercise to try out a few javascript libraries and APIs.

1. Inquirer.js - this library adds a user friendly CLI.  https://github.com/SBoudrias/Inquirer.js/
2. Themeparks API - this unofficial API for getting Disney wait times.  https://github.com/cubehouse/themeparks#supported-park-features
3. Weather JS - A simple API to get the weather. https://github.com/devfacet/weather

## To get started
1.  Clone the app and navigate to the folder.
2.  `npm install`
3.  In a terminal, type `node server`.
4.  Follow the prompts.
